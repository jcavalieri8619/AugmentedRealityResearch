    abstract={ This article presents an augmented reality platform for 
mountain bikers. The system is embedded in a full-face helmet with three 
types of augmented reality overlays projected onto the visor. Arrow 
markers positioned onto the trail for navigation, rider tracking to 
identify other riders in the trail, and simulation of hitting approaching 
jumps with user’s riding characteristics and projecting a green or red 
overlay on the jump incline to indicate whether simulation results in 
successful landing or not. Overlay projection require user’s gaze to be 
fixated on the trail so that the overlay is not obscuring peripheral 
vision—this is achieved via an eye tracking system incorporated into the 
AR helmet.
